# Elevator Challenge – Lift System Simulation

This project is a **realistic elevator system simulation** (like in malls or buildings) where multiple lifts respond to floor requests based on their availability.

Built using only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** – no libraries or frameworks!

---

##  How It Works

- At the beginning, users can **enter the number of elevators (lifts)** and **number of floors** they want to simulate
- Based on the input, the system generates the elevator setup
  
- When a floor is requested:
  - The system checks which elevators are *busy* or *free*
  - Then finds the *nearest available elevator*
  - That elevator moves to the requested floor with smooth animation
- If all lifts are busy, it shows a message indicating the lift are busy

---

##  Challenges I Faced

1. Moving elevators (divs) dynamically with JavaScript and CSS
2. Tracking which elevator is currently busy
3. Writing logic to find the **nearest free lift**
4. Managing multiple simultaneous lift requests without breaking animations

##  What I Learned

- DOM manipulation in pure JavaScript
- Real-time logic implementation without any libraries
- Customizing UI behavior with clean JS logic
- How to replicate real-life systems through code
